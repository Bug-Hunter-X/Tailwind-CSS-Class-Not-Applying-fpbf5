I'm encountering an unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS where a specific class isn't being applied, even though it's correctly included in my HTML and Tailwind configuration.  I've checked for typos and ensured the class name is consistent. I'm applying the class directly to an element, not through another class, and I've purged the CSS.  The class in question is `bg-red-500`. I've tried restarting my development server multiple times.
