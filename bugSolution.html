The issue was likely caused by an incorrect import statement or a missing configuration step in Tailwind setup. Here's a possible solution: First, make sure that the Tailwind directives are correctly set up in your HTML file: 
```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title>Tailwind CSS Class Bug</title>
   <link href="../output.css" rel="stylesheet">
 </head>
 <body class="bg-gray-100">
   <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
     This div should have a red background
   </div>
 </body>
 </html>
 ```
Ensure that you've correctly configured and built your CSS using the appropriate Tailwind directives. The output.css file should contain the compiled styles.  Incorrectly configured paths or missing Tailwind configuration files can also lead to this error. Always double check your configuration files to make sure there are no conflicts or errors.
